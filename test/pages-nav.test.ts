// WHY A SOURCE-LEVEL TEST. These pages disappeared from the desktop rail for
// several releases and nothing failed: they were reachable only through the
// project picker's "Pages" optgroup, and when the rail switched to the repo-only
// drawer picker that group silently vanished. Typechecking cannot see a lost
// entry point, and this repo's `tsc` (TypeScript 7 native preview) does not even
// flag an undefined identifier — so the regression shipped invisibly.
//
// These assertions are about *reachability*, which is the property that broke.
