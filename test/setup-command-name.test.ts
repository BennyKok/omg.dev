// Which binaries a setup run puts on PATH, and which name it refuses to take.

// Two different programs answer to `omg`: the npm CLI (@omg-dev/cli), and this
// one. When both installed the name, PATH order decided which program `omg`
// meant — so the same command did different things on different machines, and
// the winner could flip after a setup run, in a new shell, with no visible
// cause. `omg setup` printing the deploy CLI's help instead of provisioning
// the box was this bug.
//
// The rule under test: `lfg` is always installed, and `omg` is claimed only
// when no other program already holds it. The npm CLI forwards what it does
// not own to `lfg`, so letting it win loses nothing.
