// The worktree sweeper decides "is this session still alive?" from tmux and the
// managed registry. Both are proxies, and both lie for harness backends
// (aisdk / codex-aisdk / opencode): they run as bare processes with no tmux
// session, so `tmuxHasSession` is always false and the registry becomes a
// single point of failure. When serve restarted and session-recovery didn't
// re-adopt one, the sweeper deleted the worktree of a still-running agent —
// uncommitted work included. (Observed 2026-08-06: lfg-619705 and lfg-8b32e1
// were both removed while their processes were still running in them.)
//
// The guard is /proc/<pid>/cwd: ground truth, and additive-only — it can keep a
// worktree but never remove one.
//
// This runs the sweeper in a subprocess pinned to a throwaway LFG_WORKTREE_ROOT.
// Importing it here would sweep the developer's REAL worktrees as a side effect.
