#!/usr/bin/env bun
// The dependency-advisory gate. Replaces the bare
//
//   bun audit --audit-level=high --ignore=GHSA-jfgx-wxx8-mp94
//
// that audit.yml used to run, for two reasons — one that had already bitten and
// one that was about to.
//
// 1. An `--ignore` flag has no exit condition. The workflow comment beside that
//    flag said the advisory covered `@mariozechner/pi-coding-agent >=0.50.0
//    <=0.73.1`, that 0.73.1 was the newest release, and so "there is no version
//    to upgrade to. Drop this ignore as soon as a fixed release exists."
//    All true when written. It stopped being true on 2026-06-04: pi was renamed
//    to `@earendil-works/pi-coding-agent` and patched in 0.78.1. Nothing was
//    watching, so for two months a green audit meant "we are suppressing a live,
//    fixable high-severity advisory" and read as "we are clean".
//
//    So every exception here is re-verified against the GitHub advisory API on
//    every run. An exception justified as `no-fix-available` fails the build the
//    moment upstream ships a fix — including one published under a *renamed
//    successor package*, which is exactly the case a naive check misses, since
//    our own package entry says `first_patched_version: null` and always will.
//    Every exception also carries a hard `reviewBy` date, so even a correctly
//    justified one cannot be sat on indefinitely.
//
// 2. `bun audit` resolves the *workspace* lockfile, not whichever bun.lock sits
//    in the directory it was run from. That is subtle enough to have already
//    produced a wrong answer here: `web` was briefly listed as a second audit
//    root, and because `web` is a member of the root `workspaces` list, it just
//    re-audited the root graph while the summary reported two lockfiles
//    covered. assertRootsAreDistinct() now refuses to run in that state —
//    inflated coverage is worse than none, because it is the number people
//    trust.
//
// Run locally:
//   bun run audit                 # the gate
//   bun run audit -- --offline    # skip the advisory-API re-verification
//   bun run audit:exceptions      # re-record scripts/audit-exceptions.json
// CI: .github/workflows/audit.yml (push to main, every PR, Mondays 09:00 UTC)

 * new, it audits the root a second time under a different label. assertRootsAreDistinct()
 * below refuses to run in that state rather than reporting inflated coverage.
 *
 * A root also names the tool that can read it. `mobile` is not a member of the
 * root `workspaces` list, so nothing the root audit runs will ever see its
 * graph; it is audited as its own root.
 *
 * It used to be an npm root, and this comment used to say so — including that
 * the escape route once recorded against it, "convert it to bun.lock", "was
 * never going to happen". It happened: this branch converted the Expo app to
 * bun and deleted `mobile/package-lock.json`. Nobody moved the tool with it, so
 * `npm audit` was pointed at a lockfile that no longer existed and the gate died
 * with "This command requires an existing lockfile" on every PR in the mobile
 * stack. The coverage test had been saying exactly this the whole time —
 * `mobile/bun.lock` neither audited nor excluded — but a hard failure in the
 * audit step exits before the tests run, so the accurate message was never the
 * one anybody read.
 *
 * Two things worth keeping from that: a root's tool has to move when its
 * lockfile does, and a gate that dies before its own diagnostics run will
 * misreport why it is red.
