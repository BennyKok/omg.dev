// Tailing the harness command file (data/aisdk/<sessionId>.cmd).
//
// Every harness backend (aisdk, codex-aisdk, opencode, pi) reads its control
// input from an append-only JSONL command file. Getting the cursor arithmetic
// right matters more than it looks: the file is the FULL command history of the
// session, so a cursor that wrongly rewinds to 0 re-sends every message the user
// ever typed as a brand-new turn.
//
// Two bugs this module exists to prevent:
//
// 1. BYTES vs CHARACTERS. The cursor was seeded from `statSync().size` (bytes)
//    but compared against `readFileSync(f,"utf8").length` (UTF-16 code units).
//    Any non-ASCII byte in the history — "…", "—", "→", emoji, CJK — makes
//    bytes > chars, so the poll read `length < offset`, concluded the file had
//    been truncated, reset the cursor to 0, and replayed the entire history on
//    the next tick. Smart punctuation from voice transcription triggered this
//    essentially every time. Everything here is in BYTES, end to end.
//
// 2. TORN APPENDS. A poll can land between the write of a line's bytes and its
//    trailing newline. Consuming to end-of-buffer would parse half a JSON object
//    and drop the command. We only ever consume through the last complete
//    newline and leave the remainder for the next tick.
//
// The cursor is also persisted (<cmd file>.cursor) so a harness that restarts
// after a crash resumes exactly where it stopped: commands queued while it was
// down still get delivered, and commands already delivered do not repeat.
