// The shared, in-process MCP endpoint.
//
// OMG used to register its MCP server with every coding agent as a *stdio*
// server, so each agent CLI spawned its own `bun src/cli.ts mcp` child. On a
// box running 14 sessions that was 14 identical Bun processes costing ~38 MB of
// anonymous memory each — ~540 MB — whose only job was to translate MCP calls
// into HTTP calls against the `omg serve` process already running beside them.
//
// The MCP server holds no state (see buildOmgMcpServer: every tool is a proxied
// HTTP call to this same process), so the serve process can answer every agent
// itself. Agents whose CLI can register an HTTP MCP server are pointed here
// instead, and the per-session processes disappear.
