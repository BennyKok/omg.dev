Running one coding agent in a terminal is fine. Running five is not: they die
when you close the laptop, you can't tell which one is stuck waiting on a
permission prompt, and you have to be at your desk to answer it.

omg.dev turns a Linux box or macOS workstation into a private control plane for
Claude Code, Codex, OpenCode, Jcode, Cursor, Grok, fx, Pi, and GitHub Copilot.
Each
agent runs in a long-lived `tmux` session that survives disconnects. The
transcript streams to a web UI you can install as a PWA — so you can check on
work, answer prompts, and steer from your phone.

**You bring your own agent accounts.** omg.dev drives CLIs you already own and
authenticate. It does not resell tokens and has no model of its own.

## Quick start

The `omg` CLI is the supported way to install and manage omg.dev. Use whichever
package manager you already have:

```bash
bun install --global @omg-dev/cli && omg computer setup
```

```bash
npm install --global @omg-dev/cli && omg computer setup
```

> The published CLI is currently shebanged `#!/usr/bin/env bun`, so an `npm`
> install still needs `bun` on your `PATH` to run. The `bun` line above always
> works; if you install with `npm` and see
> `env: bun: No such file or directory`, install [Bun](https://bun.sh) and retry.

Then open **http://localhost:8766**.

No omg.dev account is needed for this — `omg computer setup` provisions a purely
local install. The CLI installs Bun, `tmux`, and `git`, fetches the latest
release, writes `.env`, and starts omg.dev as a user service bound to loopback.
It touches nothing outside the install directory — no sudo prompt, no daemons
you did not ask for. The extras below are opt-in. On a fresh Ubuntu/Debian box, add
`OMG_INSTALL_SYSTEM_DEPS=1` so it may `apt-get` the base packages.

The install lands in `~/omg` and runs as `omg.service` (launchd: `dev.omg.serve`).

Setup downloads a bundle built for your exact OS and CPU with dependencies
already installed, so nothing is resolved, compiled, or fetched from npm on your
machine. See [how installs stay small](#how-installs-stay-small).

Next: [connect a coding agent](#connect-a-coding-agent) so you have something to
run, then [reach it from your phone](#reach-it-from-your-phone).

### Optional extras

Everything that reaches outside the install directory is off by default and can
be turned on later, once omg.dev is already running.

**A named local URL.** Gives the UI a memorable address without binding the
server to any non-loopback interface. Setup takes the cheapest route available:

- If a public DNS name already points at `127.0.0.1` — `local.omg.dev` — it is
  used as-is. No sudo, no hosts file, nothing for uninstall to undo, and it
  behaves the same on macOS and Linux. Only trusted when *every* address it
  resolves to is loopback.
- Otherwise, opt in to an `/etc/hosts` entry, which works offline and for any
  name you like, but is root-owned:

```bash
OMG_LOCAL_HOSTNAME=omg.local omg setup   # needs sudo: /etc/hosts is root-owned
```

Either way `http://localhost:8766` keeps working.
`omg uninstall` removes the entry. Note that browsers only grant "secure
context" to `https://`, `localhost`, and loopback IPs — so **install the PWA
from `localhost:8766`**, not from `omg.local`, or the service worker will not
register.

**Remote access.** Installs Tailscale, joins your tailnet, and serves the UI
over HTTPS on your tailnet only:

```bash
OMG_TAILSCALE_SERVE=1 TS_AUTHKEY=tskey-auth-... omg setup
```

That gives you a portless `https://` URL that works from your phone, with a
publicly valid certificate and nothing exposed to your LAN or the internet.

### Run from source

For development and forks:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/BennyKok/omg.dev.git
cd omg.dev
bun install
cp .env.example .env
bun run serve
```

Open `http://localhost:8766`. For UI hot reload (proxies `/api` to the Bun
server): `cd web && bun install && bun run dev`.

### What you need

The CLI handles all of this; this list is for the from-source path and for the
curious.

- [Bun](https://bun.sh), `tmux`, `git`
- At least one coding agent CLI — see [below](#connect-a-coding-agent)
- Optional: [Tailscale](https://tailscale.com) for private remote access

## Why omg.dev?

- **Run agents where your code lives.** Sessions execute on your machine, in
  your repos, with your local CLIs and credentials — not a remote sandbox you
  have to keep in sync.
- **Bring your own accounts.** Claude, Codex, OpenCode, Cursor, Grok, fx,
  Copilot, and Pi all run on subscriptions and keys you already have.
- **One UI for every harness.** Switch agents and models per session, resume
  work, answer permission prompts, and manage projects from an installable PWA.
- **Survive the lid closing.** `tmux`-backed sessions keep running when you
  disconnect, and pick up exactly where they were when you come back.
- **Keep it private.** The server binds to loopback by default and is designed
  to be exposed through Tailscale, not the public internet.
- **Delegate with lineage.** omg.dev MCP tools spawn subagents that stay visible in
  the UI, inherit parent context, and report progress back.
- **Show the work.** Agents can display verification media, publish updatable
  HTML dashboards, and post finished results to the Shipped feed.
- **Automate repo checks.** Optional markdown-defined agents collect git, repo,
  GitHub, model, or security context and produce scheduled reports.

## Connect a coding agent

omg.dev drives agent CLIs that you own and authenticate. Open **Settings → Coding
agents** in the web UI to install one, check its binary path and auth state, and
register omg.dev's MCP server with it.

| Agent | Command | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code | `claude` | Installed by setup |
| OpenAI Codex | `codex` | |
| OpenCode | `opencode` | |
| Jcode | `jcode` | |
| Cursor | `cursor-agent` | |
| Grok | `grok` | |
| fx | `fx` | Vercel AI Gateway account (`fx login`) or `AI_GATEWAY_API_KEY` |
| GitHub Copilot | `copilot` | Needs Node 22+ |
| Pi | *installed on request* | `OMG_INSTALL_PI=1 omg setup` — its provider layer pulls ~115 MB, so it is not shipped by default |

OAuth-based agents need a one-time terminal or browser login. API-key providers
read env vars such as `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `OPENAI_API_KEY` from `.env`. Pi
authenticates via `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` or `~/.pi/agent/auth.json`.

**Settings → Coding agents → Install MCP** registers omg.dev MCP with Claude, Codex,
OpenCode, Jcode, Grok, and Cursor when those CLIs are present. (Copilot and Pi have no
MCP registration surface. fx needs no registration: its ACP session receives the
omg.dev MCP server over the wire at launch.) Setup does this automatically for
Claude and Codex when they are already installed.

## Reach it from your phone

omg.dev binds to loopback and has **no authentication of its own** — it trusts the
network you put it behind. There are two supported ways to reach it remotely:

**Tailscale (recommended).** The simplest choice if you only open the UI from
your own devices:

```bash
OMG_TAILSCALE_SERVE=1 omg setup
```

**A relay (experimental).** For the case Tailscale can't cover — rendering a
session from your box on a *public* web origin:

```bash
OMG_RELAY_URL=wss://your-relay.example/connect omg connect ABC123   # outbound only, no inbound port
```

No relay ships with omg.dev itself; the protocol is generic and any operator can
implement it. [omg.dev](https://omg.dev) runs one, and the CLI configures the
pairing for you:

```bash
omg login
omg connect        # installs omg.dev if needed, then pairs and connects
```

Full comparison, the pairing flow, and opt-in session lifecycle events:
**[docs/remote-access.md](./docs/remote-access.md)**.

Do not put omg.dev on the public internet without your own auth in front of it.
See [Security](#security).

## Security

omg.dev launches AI agents with shell access on your machine. The control API is
unauthenticated by design because it is meant to run on loopback and be reached
privately through Tailscale.

**Do not expose omg.dev directly to the public internet.** Read
[SECURITY.md](./SECURITY.md) before sharing access.

## Don't want to run a box?

[![Deploy on omg.dev](https://omg.dev/deploy-badge.svg?v=2)](https://omg.dev/sandbox/templates/lfg)

[omg.dev](https://omg.dev) is the hosted version, run by the same author — a
cloud machine with omg.dev already running, so there's nothing to install and no
server to provision. There's a free tier, and it's entirely optional: everything
above works forever without an account.

One click gives you a workspace with the omg.dev web UI already up. Workspaces
hibernate when idle and wake on the same URL.

> **Which should I pick?** Install locally if you want agents working on the
> repos and authenticated CLIs already on your machine — that is what omg.dev is
> for. Use omg.dev to try it in seconds, or when you would rather not run a box
> at all. A fresh hosted workspace has no agent CLIs signed in, and agents work
> on repos you clone *into* it. More detail in [deploy/omg](./deploy/omg/README.md).

## Managing an install

The `omg` CLI wraps the whole lifecycle:

```bash
omg computer setup                     # install omg.dev (no omg.dev account needed)
omg computer status                    # inspect the local install and pairing
omg computer update                    # update an existing installation
omg computer uninstall                 # remove omg.dev; preserve sessions and config
omg computer uninstall --purge --yes   # also permanently delete local omg.dev data
```

`update` never installs a missing computer, and `uninstall` delegates cleanup to
omg.dev instead of guessing which files it owns. Removal stops the service and
deletes its command, MCP registrations, `/etc/hosts` entry, and release files.
Shared prerequisites such as Bun, Tailscale, `tmux`, and coding-agent CLIs are
left alone; source checkouts are preserved unless explicitly purged.

The same operations are available from inside an install:

```bash
omg setup                     # update and re-run idempotent provisioning
omg uninstall                 # remove omg.dev; keep sessions and config for reinstall
omg uninstall --purge --yes   # also permanently delete sessions and config
```

## Commands

```bash
omg serve                      # web UI + control server
omg doctor                     # shareable diagnostic to paste into a bug report
omg setup                      # rerun provisioning/update flow
omg uninstall                  # remove omg.dev while preserving sessions and config
omg connect <code>             # reach this box through a relay (see docs/remote-access.md)
omg mcp                        # stdio MCP server for omg.dev session tools
omg agents list                # list markdown-defined insight agents
omg agents run <name>          # run an insight agent
omg subagent models            # list runtime sub-agent providers/models
omg subagent create --prompt "..." --agent codex-aisdk
```

From a source checkout, use `bun run <command>` (e.g. `bun run serve`) — the
surface is identical.

## Something is wrong

Run `omg doctor` and paste what it prints.

```bash
omg doctor          # a fenced block: versions, agents, accounts, server, recent errors
omg doctor --json   # the same facts, machine-readable
```

It answers the questions a bug report otherwise takes several rounds to
establish: which version, which agent CLIs exist, whether any account is
connected, whether the server is up, and the recent log lines that look like
failures. It works when omg.dev is broken — it does not need the server, and a
probe that fails is reported rather than aborting the rest.

API keys, tokens, and your home directory are removed before it prints, so the
output is safe to paste into a public issue or Discord.

If a session never starts, `doctor` usually names the cause outright: no coding
agent installed, or none signed in.

## MCP tools

`omg mcp` talks to the local `omg serve` API and exposes omg.dev's session tools to
any MCP client. Prefer omg.dev's own subagent tools over a client's generic "spawn
agent" helper so children stay visible in the UI, inherit parent and user
context, and can run on any configured harness.

| Area | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Sessions | `omg_list_sessions`, `omg_find_sessions`, `omg_get_session_tree`, `omg_get_session_messages`, `omg_send_session_message`, `omg_close_session` |
| Origin delivery | `omg_send_to_origin` |
| Presentation | `omg_display_image`, `omg_display_video`, `omg_publish_artifact`, `omg_refresh_artifact`, `omg_delete_artifact`, `omg_ship` |
| Delegation | `omg_create_subagent`, `omg_delegate_to_agent`, `omg_delegate_design_task`, `omg_delegate_backend_task`, `omg_list_subagents`, `omg_reparent_session` |
| Auto agents | `omg_list_auto_agents`, `omg_compose_auto_agent`, `omg_save_auto_agent`, `omg_run_auto_agent`, `omg_delete_auto_agent`, `omg_list_findings`, `omg_update_finding` |
| Human input | `omg_ask_user`, `omg_input` |
| Catalog | `omg_capabilities`, `omg_list_repos`, `omg_list_models` |

Managed sessions launched with an initial task receive a versioned **omg.dev runtime
contract** (when to show media, publish artifacts, ask the user, delegate, or
ship). Sessions started on an older contract are marked in the UI so they can be
closed and resumed to pick up the current tool catalog.

Subagents may nest up to four levels. Each child sends `[subagent progress]`
updates and one terminal `[subagent complete]` / `[subagent blocked]` /
`[subagent failed]` message to its parent.

## Configuration

Configuration lives in `.env`. **[`.env.example`](./.env.example) documents every
variable inline.**

Variables use the `OMG_` prefix. These are the ones most people touch:

| Variable | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `OMG_HOST` | Bind address. Keep `127.0.0.1` unless you know the risk. |
| `OMG_PORT` | Web UI and API port. Defaults to `8766`. |
| `OMG_LOCAL_HOSTNAME` | Named local URL mapped to loopback, e.g. `omg.local`. Empty (the default) skips the hosts file. |
| `OMG_INSTALL_TAILSCALE` | Install and join Tailscale. Off by default; implied by `OMG_TAILSCALE_SERVE`. |
| `OMG_REPOS_ROOT` | Directory scanned for git repos. |
| `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` | Optional API key for Claude / Pi flows. |
| `OMG_<AGENT>_PATH` | Override a CLI's binary path (`OMG_CLAUDE_PATH`, `OMG_CODEX_PATH`, `OMG_OPENCODE_PATH`, `OMG_JCODE_PATH`, `OMG_CURSOR_PATH`, `OMG_FX_PATH`, `OMG_PI_PATH`, `OMG_COPILOT_PATH`). |
| `OMG_RELAY_URL` | Relay WebSocket URL for `omg connect`. See [docs/remote-access.md](./docs/remote-access.md). |
| `OMG_INSTALL_CHANNEL` | Install channel: `source`, `release`, or `container`. Usually set by setup/deploy. |

Other groups: agent-specific behaviour (`OMG_COPILOT_ALLOW_ALL_TOOLS`,
`OMG_PI_PROFILE_DIR` — see
[custom agent profiles](./docs/custom-agent-profiles.md)), relay event
forwarding (`OMG_CONNECT_EVENTS*`), and backend tracing
(`OMG_TRACE_RETENTION_DAYS`, `OMG_TRACE_TRANSCRIPT_*`).

Backend diagnostics append to `data/logs/trace-YYYY-MM-DD.jsonl` (API timings,
transcript indexing, live stream stalls, send queue state).

## How installs stay small

Each release publishes a bundle per platform — `omg-linux-x64.tar.gz`,
`omg-linux-arm64.tar.gz`, `omg-darwin-x64.tar.gz`, `omg-darwin-arm64.tar.gz` —
with `node_modules` already installed for that target. Setup downloads the one
matching your machine and skips dependency resolution entirely.

A first install used to pull about **2 GB** and resolve the graph locally. It is
now **43 MB**, and nothing is resolved on your machine. Two things got removed:

**Builds the machine cannot execute (667 MB).** npm gates platform packages with
the `os`, `cpu`, and `libc` manifest fields. Bun honours `os` and `cpu` when
resolving `optionalDependencies` but *not* `libc`, and there is no
`bun install --libc` to opt out — so every glibc Linux install also downloaded
the musl builds of the Claude agent SDK, both opencode variants, and sharp's
libvips.

**Agent runtimes omg.dev does not need (about 1 GB).** The Claude, Codex, and
OpenCode SDKs each bundle a private copy of that agent's binary, as a fallback
for machines without the CLI. omg.dev already prefers the CLI on your machine —
`pathToClaudeCodeExecutable`, `codexPathOverride`, and a `PATH` lookup for
opencode — which is the whole premise of bringing your own agent accounts. So
the bundled copies are dropped, and you install the agents you actually want:

```bash
# from the UI: Settings → Coding agents → Install
OMG_INSTALL_CLAUDE=1 OMG_INSTALL_OPENCODE=1 omg setup   # or headless
OMG_INSTALL_PI=1 omg setup          # pi, plus its provider SDKs
```

That is also how a hosted image ships with agents preinstalled — the same lean
bundle, plus the agents it wants on top. Pi is installed on request too (`OMG_INSTALL_PI=1 omg setup`): it has no
separately installable binary, and its provider layer pulls ~115 MB.

[`scripts/prune-modules.ts`](./scripts/prune-modules.ts) does both removals at
release time and sweeps the symlinks left behind. Building bundles for other
platforms works because `bun install --os --cpu` resolves another target's
optional dependencies, so a Linux CI box can produce correct macOS bundles.

```bash
scripts/release.sh                                 # neutral bundle + all platforms
LFG_RELEASE_PLATFORMS="linux-x64" scripts/release.sh
LFG_BUNDLE_AGENT_RUNTIMES=1 scripts/release.sh     # keep the bundled agent binaries
LFG_SKIP_PLATFORM_BUNDLES=1 scripts/release.sh     # neutral bundle only
```

The platform-neutral `omg-bundle.tar.gz` is still published, and setup falls
back to it (then to the pre-rename `lfg-bundle.tar.gz`) when no platform bundle
matches — an unusual architecture still installs, it just resolves dependencies
locally the old way.

## Embedding omg.dev in your own product

Every release publishes `@omg-dev/protocol`, `@omg-dev/client`, `@omg-dev/react`,
and `@omg-dev/app` to npm — the last being the exact full application the
standalone web UI runs. React hosts mount it with their own transport and asset
origin:

```bash
npm install @omg-dev/app @omg-dev/client
```

See **[docs/embedding.md](./docs/embedding.md)**.
